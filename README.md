# Masters-Architecture
This repository contains my work for the Games Architecture module of my Masters course at City University of London.

The Lab folders can be ignored as they contain tutorial work done during the course, but the Coursework folder contains my Monogame project.

The project was a 2D platformer game built with an event driven architecture, and data driven configuration.
